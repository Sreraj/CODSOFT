🛡️ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project, completed as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Codsoft, focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

🚀 Project Highlights

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed data, handled missing values, and addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
EDA: Visualized transaction patterns and identified trends in categories, gender, and fraud distribution.
Model Development: Built and compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, achieving an accuracy of 88% with Logistic Regression.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

📊 Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of 88%, effectively identifying fraudulent transactions.
